# ObjectDetectionApp
<h1>Object Detection Application</h1>
<p>This is an Android application to help blind user to recognise the objects in their life. The application will scan the real time object using smartphone camera and inform user the name of the object using speech feedback. </p>
<p>The object detection will be done using Tensorflow Object Detection API. However, I need to apply transfer learning to the pre-trained models to improve the performance of the default models.</p>
<h3>Development Tools</h3>
<li>Tensorflow Object Detection API</li>
<li>Android Studio</li>

<h3>To-Do</h3>
<li>Feature that provides voice feedback to tell user the name of object detected.</li>
<li>Feature that allows user to adjust the speed of the speech feedback</li>
<li>Feature to repeat the speech
